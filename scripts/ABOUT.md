# Utilities and tests using the dataset

The content at analysis\raw_reports folder must be generated with [this script at the sample picker repository, since it needs CUDA-dependent libraries](https://github.com/kauevestena/deep_pavements_sample_picker/blob/main/quality_tests/test_surface_samples.py)


# Getting started

Create a virtual environment:

    virtualenv dpd

Install dependencies:

    pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt

(or simply use VSCode)
